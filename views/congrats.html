            <div class="half--body font-light">American Addiction Centers views addiction as a disease that touches all members of the family in some way. We believe the disease of addiction affects each family member at the same level as it does the individual "just differently" therefore, we treat the whole family system. In addiction to offering on-site family therapy sessions and intensive workshops, our family program is offered online and via telephone conference. Our family program uses teh Systemic Family Intervention Model developed by Wayne Raiter, MA, LICSW.</div>
